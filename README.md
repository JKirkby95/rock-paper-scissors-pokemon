# Pokéduel

![am i responsive photo](assets/images/amiresponsive1.png)

Pokéduel is my take on the game Roack Paper Scissors Lizard Spock made famous by the Big Bang Theory. My thinking behind it was Pokemon are set up like Rock Paper Scissors at the beginning. Fire, Water and Grass types act like the original game. I added Pikachu and Pidgey to make up the 5 and they are part of the original Pokedex. I used Pokemon to put a new spin on the game and because it was a huge part of my childhood.

- Contains minimal colors to keep the design simple and allow brighter colors to stand out.

### Color Scheme

![website color scheme](assets/images/color_scheme_pokeduel.png)

The colors I used for this site were picked carefully, the color rgba(220, 215, 201) for the text boxes was insprired by the text boxes from the old games.(see below)
The red #ff0000 is the same as in the original pokeball. Black and white were also a big part of any game back then so I decided to keep the colors as close to the games as I could.

### Typography

I imported a custom font from [dafont.com](https://www.dafont.com/pkmn-rbygsc.font), this font plays a huge part in how the game looks and feels. Pokemons font is iconic and avid fans will spot it from a mile away. I wasn't sure how to import a custom font at first so i did set a fall back option of sans-serif incase it doesn't load for the user.

### Wireframes

For my wireframes I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/), my wireframes didn't end up exactly like the final project but it gave me a great idea of how it would look.

### Testing User Stories

### Code Validation

- When running my code through the I did find a few errors.
